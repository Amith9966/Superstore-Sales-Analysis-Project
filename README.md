# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview

The Superstore Sales Analysis project utilizes data from a CSV file, `Superstore.csv`, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using Python libraries such as `pandas` and `plotly`. This analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can drive decision-making for improving business performance.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** Superstore.csv
- **Columns Overview:**
  - **Order Date**: The date an order was placed.
  - **Ship Date**: The date an order was shipped.
  - **Sales**: Revenue generated from sales.
  - **Profit**: Net earnings from sales after costs.
  - **Category & Sub-Category**: Product classification.
  - **Region**: The geographical area of the sales.
  - **Customer Segment**: The type of customer.
  - **Discount**: Discount offered on sales.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Imported the dataset using `pandas`.
- Checked for null values and handled missing data (if any).
- Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.
- Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime formats.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Added new columns for advanced analysis:

- **Order Month**: Extracted the month from the `Order Date`.
- **Order Year**: Extracted the year from the `Order Date`.
- **Order Day of Week**: Extracted the day of the week from the `Order Date`.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the dataset to identify patterns and trends:

- **Sales Trends Over Time**:
  - Monthly and yearly sales trends using `plotly` line plots.

- **Top Performing Categories**:
  - Bar charts to compare sales and profit across categories and sub-categories.

- **Regional Analysis**:
  - Geographical insights on sales and profit distributions.

- **Customer Segments**:
  - Segmentation analysis to identify high-value customer groups.

- **Profitability**:
  - Identified products or regions contributing to losses using discount and profit correlations.

### 4. Visualizations

Used `plotly` for interactive visualizations:

- **Line Charts** for time-series analysis of sales.
- **Bar Charts** for comparing categorical data.
- **Heatmaps** for understanding correlations between variables.
- **Pie Charts** for visualizing segment-wise contributions.

## Key Insights

1. **Monthly Sales Trends:** Sales peak during specific months, likely due to seasonality or promotional events.
2. **Regional Performance:** The highest sales occur in specific regions, with some regions generating higher profits despite lower sales.
3. **Discount Impact:** Excessive discounts negatively affect profitability in certain categories.
4. **Customer Insights:** Corporate customers generate higher profits, while consumer segments benefit most from discounts.
